# Auction-Platform
Source code for an auction platform called Adwyn

## Running

After cloning the repository, cd into the directory and use 'npm install' to install all the npm project's dependencies. Then use 'bower install' to install all bower dependencies. Then use "grunt" to start the application. Open a browser and navigate to the localhost and port number set in the application (5000 currently).

## Lessons Learned

* I began working on this project with the intent of building the front-end. As I progressed I learned full-stack JavaScript skills and additional infrastructure skills.
* I worked on this project as part of a business endeavor called Adwyn, and while I no longer continue with the company, I was able to learn useful entrepreneurial insights.

## Notes

* You might need to install the grunt client to run grunt.
* This code began as the MEAN stack boilerplate from meanjs.org
